# Impact of Global Events on Market Trends

This project explores the **relationships between global events** (e.g., wars, pandemics, and energy shifts) and their impact on stock markets, GDP trends, and energy performance, using interactive visualizations built with **Observable** and **Plotly.js**.

---

## Key Features

1. **Interactive Graphs**:
    - **COVID-19 Impact**: Visualize changes in GDP across countries during the pandemic.
    - **War Trends**: Analyze defense sector stock performance during major conflicts.
    - **Energy Performance**: Compare clean and dirty energy performance over time.

2. **Geospatial Visualizations**:
    - Map-based representations of GDP and other economic indicators.
    - Highlight regions affected by specific global events.

3. **Real-Time Interactivity**:
    - Dynamic sliders and selectors for filtering time ranges.
    - Toggle visibility for individual data sets (e.g., clean vs. dirty energy).

4. **Data-Driven Insights**:
    - Aggregated data from diverse sources (e.g., GDP trends, energy markets).
    - Provides an intuitive exploration of complex datasets.
