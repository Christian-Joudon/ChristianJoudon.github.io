summary: "I designed a software that extracts and compiles a keyword dictionary for individual characters from film or TV scripts."
---

In pursuit of advancing game dynamics, I aim to develop keyword dictionaries derived from expansive network systems that mirror real personalities. The ultimate objective, though ambitious, is to design generative AI-driven non-player characters (NPCs) that autonomously generate dialogue based on a player's in-game progress. This innovation promises decision-centric gameplay, wherein NPCs not only react to the evolving game world but also offer unique event-based interactions. The current landscape already boasts chatbots proficient in real-time responses, indicating feasibility. Beyond mere semantics, my vision encompasses the nuanced syntax and distinct "personality" of each NPC, enhancing overall gameplay immersion.

Utilizing the comprehensive script resources of the Internet Movie Script Database (https://imsdb.com), I developed a software that analyzes screenplays. Upon input, it identifies a specific character, extracts their dialogue, and compiles every word into a comprehensive dictionary. To further refine this data, the software employs the latest natural language processing algorithms, extracting key terms that encapsulate the character's "personality". This innovative approach not only catalogs words but also offers insights into character nuances.
