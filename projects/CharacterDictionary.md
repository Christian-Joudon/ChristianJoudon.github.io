summary: "I designed a software that extracts and compiles a keyword dictionary for individual characters from film or TV scripts."
---

In pursuit of advancing game dynamics, I embarked on a project to develop keyword dictionaries using expansive network systems reflecting genuine personalities. The overarching goal is to create generative AI-driven non-player characters (NPCs) capable of autonomously generating dialogues based on player's in-game progress. This innovative approach sets the stage for decision-driven gameplay, where NPCs not only adapt to the game's evolution but also engage players through distinct event-based interactions. While current technologies already showcase chatbots adept in real-time interactions, the feasibility of my endeavor becomes evident. More than just semantics, my aspiration dives deep into ensuring each NPC showcases nuanced syntax and a unique "personality", promising an enriched gameplay experience.

Leveraging the extensive resources of the [Internet Movie Script Database](https://imsdb.com), my software stands as a tool adept in analyzing screenplays. It identifies characters, sieves through their dialogues, and meticulously crafts a comprehensive dictionary for each. With the integration of cutting-edge natural language processing algorithms, it distills keywords, offering a glimpse into the very "personality" of the characters. Beyond cataloging words, the software illuminates the intricate layers of character depth.
