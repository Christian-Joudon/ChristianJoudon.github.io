## Introduction

At UH Manoa, the student body is bustling with clubs and organizations that foster community, learning, and networking.

- **Proximity-based Club Discovery:** Geolocation features will assist users in finding nearby events while prioritizing privacy and security.
- **Virtual Collaboration:** Integration with platforms like Zoom or Google Meet to accommodate online club meetings and events.
- **Event Swiper Mechanism:** A swipe-right interface for event interest, adding a gamified element to event browsing.

## Mockups and User Flows
