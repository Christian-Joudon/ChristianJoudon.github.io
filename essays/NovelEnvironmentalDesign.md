# Dynamic Environmental Systems in RPGs

## Introduction

Modern RPGs often face challenges in creating immersive, interactive environments that evolve with player actions. The goal of this project was to develop systems that transform static game landscapes into dynamic, player-influenced worlds. This involves integrating algorithms for weather, NPC behavior, terrain alteration, and environmental interactions, enabling environments to adapt and respond dynamically.

## Key Contributions

1. **Dynamic Weather and Environmental Effects**  
   - **Algorithms Used**: ARIMA, STL, Neural Networks, and GIS Spatial Analysis.  
   - **Features**: Real-time weather pattern simulations affecting gameplay, including storm pattern recognition and environmental hazards.

2. **Interactive Objects and Materials**  
   - Developed systems for cataloging object properties and defining interaction rules using hash tables and FSMs.  
   - Included multi-use functionality for objects, allowing diverse and context-based interactions.

3. **Dynamic Quests and Storylines**  
   - Used Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) and Finite State Machines (FSM) to integrate environmental changes into quests and narratives.  
   - Enabled trigger-based quest generation and real-time storyline adjustments.

4. **Real-Time Terrain Modification**  
   - **Technologies**: Sparse Voxel Octrees, adaptive tessellation, and procedural deformation.  
   - **Impact**: Allowed players to modify terrain with persistent effects, influencing resource distribution, NPC pathfinding, and gameplay strategies.
