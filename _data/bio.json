    "summary": "My background in Biochemistry provided a strong scientific foundation, while diverse roles in hospitality and project management honed my communication and project coordination skills. My creative pursuits—writing a full-length screenplay and composing over a hundred songs—helped me learn how to express complex ideas and think outside the box.
Now, as a recent Computer Science graduate, I aim to blend analytical rigor with creativity, developing novel, human-centered systems that are both engaging and meaningful.",
