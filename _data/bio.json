    "summary": "Enrolled in Computer Science at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, I began my academic pursuit in Biochemistry for three years, gaining foundational knowledge in chemistry and biology. My five years in the restaurant sector, covering both front and back roles, enhanced my communication skills, necessitated by diverse clientele and team collaboration. Beyond academia and work, I have expertise in filmmaking, including screenwriting, photography, lighting, and editing. My comprehensive understanding of films from the last two decades demonstrates both passion and analytical proficiency. Creativity underscores my endeavors, from songwriting to using interior design software such as LiveHome3d. As I delve into computer science, I merge analytical rigor, creativity, and communicative competence.  I am interested to see what my diverse insights can add to the Computer Science Industry.",
